# Developer-Informed Feedback for Validating the Terraform and AWS CloudFormation Cost Linter

This project evaluates a previously developed cost linter for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). We apply the tool to open-source GitHub repositories, identify cost-related misconfigurations, and engage with developers through issue reporting to study their awareness, reactions and feedback on cost considerations.
