  check_name: S3 Lifecycle Configurations
  description: Verifies that S3 buckets have lifecycle configurations with at least
    one rule defined. Missing rules may lead to data retention in expensive storage
    indefinitely, thus increasing costs.
  recommendations:
  - Define LifecycleConfiguration in the Properties section of the bucket.
  - Include a non-empty Rules list with expiration/transition logic.
- check_id: CKV_AWS_806
  check_name: DynamoDB On-Demand Billing
  description: Detects DynamoDB tables that do not use PAY_PER_REQUEST (on-demand)
    billing. This can lead to over-provisioning, unnecessary costs, or throttling
    if usage exceeds limits.
  recommendations:
  - Set BillingMode:PAY_PER_REQUEST in your DynamoDB table configuration.
  - Avoid setting the read/write capacity.
